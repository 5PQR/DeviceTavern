# bHaptics devices haptic feedback

This tool tools sends simple calls to the bHaptics Player and requires bHaptic devices https://www.bhaptics.com/ like TactGlove & TactSuit X40 for haptic feedback to get triggered. It's mostly just a wrapper to streamline setting up the connection through python by installing Miniconda on Windows devices with a simple executable. For more advanced implementations for the bHaptics devices and for haptic applications I recommend checking the bHaptics SDK https://www.bhaptics.com/en/support/developers/
